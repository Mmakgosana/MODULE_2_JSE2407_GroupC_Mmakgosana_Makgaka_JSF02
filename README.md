E-Commerce Store: React to Svelte Conversion

INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the E-Commerce Store project, my project involves converting an existing e-commerce application built with React into Svelte. The primary goal is to showcase the ability of using Svelte to achieve the same goals that were achieved using React, to also improve performance, make it more simpler, and to improve developer experience while maintaining the functionality of the original React application.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Svelte:Which is a modern framework for building user interfaces and also offer a more efficient and simpler way to build web applications.
2. Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework which I used for styling the application.
3. API: FakeStoreAPI for fetching product and category data.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
1. Clone the Resipotory, then navigate to the project directory
2. Install Dependencies(npm install and npm run dev, tailwind, svelte routing)
3. Then built the project by converting react components into svelte components.

USAGE EXAMPLES
1. View Products
   My app is able to display a list of products fetched from the fakestoreAPI, and you can also view detailed information about each product by clicking on it.
2. Filter and Search
   You can use the search bar and filter and sort to narrow down product listings based on categories and keywords and also sort according to prices.
3. Responsive Design
   The application is designed to be fully responsive, also adjust to different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.

CHALLENGES FACED
1. Component Migration
2. Converting React components to Svelte components involved rethinking component lifecycles and prop handling, which was mitigated by thoroughly reviewing Svelte's documentation and examples.
3. Styling and Layout
4. To adjust CSS styles and layout to work seamlessly with Tailwind CSS in Svelte required iterative refinement, to ensure that styles were consistent with the original React app which was time-consuming but also important for a polished user experience.

5. IMPROVEMENTS
   Performance Optimization
   Svelte's reactivity and compilation techniques led to noticeable performance improvements, the application now loads faster and is more responsive.
   Enhanced Developer Experience
   Using SvelteKit for routing and server-side rendering streamlines the development process, the improved developer experience has made it easier to add new features and troubleshoot issues.

   REFLECTIVE THOUGHTS
   Converting the e-commerce store from React to Svelte was both a challenging and rewarding experience, it required a deep dive into Svelte paradigms and best practices, thus broadening my understanding of modern web development frameworks.
   This process has highlighted the strengths and trade-offs of different technologies. Svelte offered a fresh approach with less boilerplate and a better ecosystem than React's robust ecosystem and extensive community support.
   Overall, this conversion project has been an invaluable learning opportunity and has improved my skills in both Svelte and general software development practices
